Abstract：Invasion of Spartina alterniflora poses a serious threat to the biodiversity and ecosystem health of coastal wetlands in China.
Many coastal provinces in China have initiated projects for clearance and treatment of S. alterniflora in recent years. The timely and
accurate understanding of S. alterniflora clearance dynamics is crucial in coastal wetland management and decision making. The objective
of this study was to propose a new method for monitoring S. alterniflora clearance dynamics on the basis of dense time series remote
sensing images.
The Yellow River Estuary wetland was taken as the study area in this work. First, Sentinel-2 MSI, GF-1 PMS, and GF-1 WFV images
were fused to construct time-series Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) dataset. Second, temporal variations of NDVI were
analyzed, and the potential clearance periods were detected. Finally, tidal inundation was examined and S. alterniflora clearance date was
identified by eliminating the influence of tidal inundation on NDVI time series. The map of S. alterniflora clearance dates with a spatial
resolution of 10 m was obtained for the Yellow River Estuary.
The overall accuracy of clearance dates was 88.24%, and the Kappa coefficient was 0.87. Results showed that the fusion of Sentinel-2
and GF-1 data can effectively improve the identification accuracy of clearance dates compared with the single Sentinel-2 date source. The
cleared area of S. alterniflora from September to December 2021 was 4816.35 ha, which accounts for 92.81% of the total S. alterniflora
region in the study area. Uncleared areas are mainly distributed in the coastal areas of the north shore with complex hydrology and interlaced
tidal creeks. The project was completed in two stages because of the early October flood peak in the lower reaches of the Yellow River. The
first stage was finished between early September and early October, and the second stage was concluded between mid-October and mid-
December, with the majority of S. alterniflora being cleared in early December.
The rapid and accurate observation of the dynamics of S. alterniflora clearance through the proposed method is crucial in the
monitoring and evaluation of S. alterniflora treatment and wetland restoration projects in coastal wetlands across the country. This method is
expected to be applied to the dynamic monitoring and comprehensive evaluation of the effectiveness of large-scale treatment projects.
